# Modeling-Total-Phosphorus-Loading-from-Genesee-River-Basin-to-Lake-Ontario-Using-Artificial-Neural-Network
The objective of this study is to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model with the data from a sub-watershed to estimate phosphorus loading (concentration and total loading). The trained ANN should have the potential to apply to other sub-watersheds (mainly focus on US. side) to predict phosphorus loading to Lake Ontario. The findings and the model framework from this research could be able to provide decision supporting information for controlling phosphorus loading to the lake through tributaries and watershed.

**Note: this projet is still ongoing and the codes will update in progress.**
